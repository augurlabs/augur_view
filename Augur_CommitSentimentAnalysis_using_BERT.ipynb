SSO systems are already in use in universities and research centers.  The two most common identity and access management systems are Globus for researchers (https://www.globus.org/ ) and InCommon for US students (https://www.incommon.org/solutions/).  Requirement:  Academic users will use the SSO system their university designates to access Operate First services and data._x000D_\\n2. Academic environments have public policies about acceptable use of their facilities.  This allows them to specify who has access to services and data, and under what conditions that access can be revoked.   The AUP can also specify conditions of use (such as no expectation of privacy).  CloudLab has an excellent policy that has been successfully used for academic operations for many years:  https://www.cloudlab.us/aup.php  Requirement: Operate First will use identities from requirement #1 to manage access to services and data in keeping with the facility AUP.  Only users with an active Operate First account may access services and data.   (Derived requirement:  Operate First environment will publish an AUP.  This will require academic review.)_x000D_\\n3. The onboarding process for an academic environment ensures that each user views the AUP.  Using your account means you accept the AUP.  (Academic environments almost never have license agreements for end users.)  Requirement:  Onboarding for Operate First includes showing users the AUP.   (Derived requirement:  Operate First users whose accounts predate the AUP must be contacted so they can view and accept the AUP.)_x000D_\\n4. Academic environments may further limit access to specific operations data to a subset of users for privacy or security reasons.  This level of access restriction **cannot** be supported in Operate First. Another way to express this is that the AUP must specify that operations data is available to all users with active accounts.   Requirement:  Operate First will not collect or store operations data that requires restricting data access to a subset of all active Operate First users. (This will require academic reviewers.  This requirement also negates the need for a privacy policy.  See https://www.globus.org/legal/privacy for a privacy policy successfully used for many years in Globus.)_x000D_\\nNONE of items 1-4 are actually legal agreements or contracts, so it is relatively straightforward to create and publish them._x000D_\\n5. If data is transferred into or out of an academic environment, the university requires an approved data use agreement.   The university may also require approval from an Institutional Review Board for data that involves human subjects.  Examples for BU:  https://www.bu.edu/researchsupport/forms-policies/data-use-agreement-form/ ://www.bu.edu/researchsupport/profile/institutional-review-board-irb/   Although the examples for these agreements are complex, in practice many data centers already have DUAs and IRB approvals for environments like Operate First.   Michael Daitzman is working to get DUA and (if necessary) IRB approval in advance of prodcution deployment  for Operate First data.  Requirement:  Operate First data will not be transferred into or out of the Operate First environment until we have an approved DUA and (if necessary) IRB approval from BU.', 'Asked Michael Daitzman to review requirements.', \"Looks good.
